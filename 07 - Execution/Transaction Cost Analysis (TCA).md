# Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)

Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) is the process of evaluating the costs of trading. The goal of TCA is to identify and measure the explicit and implicit costs of trading, and to find ways to reduce them.

## Explicit Costs
- **Commissions:** Fees paid to a broker for executing a trade.
- **Fees:** Fees paid to an exchange or other execution venue.
- **Taxes:** Taxes on capital gains.

## Implicit Costs
- **Market Impact:** The adverse price movement that is caused by a trade. This is the largest component of transaction costs for large trades.
- **Delay Costs (Slippage):** The difference between the price at which a trade is submitted and the price at which it is executed. This is often caused by a delay in the execution of the trade.
- **Opportunity Costs:** The cost of not trading. This can be difficult to measure, but it is an important consideration for many trading strategies.

## TCA Benchmarks
- **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):** The average price of a security over a given time period, weighted by volume. This is a common benchmark for evaluating the execution of large trades.
- **Implementation Shortfall:** The difference between the value of a hypothetical portfolio in which trades were executed instantly and the actual value of the portfolio. This is a more comprehensive measure of transaction costs than VWAP.
