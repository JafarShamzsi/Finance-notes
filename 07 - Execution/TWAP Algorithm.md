# TWAP Algorithm

The Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) algorithm is an execution algorithm that is used to execute a large order over a specified period of time. The goal of the TWAP algorithm is to execute the order at a price that is close to the time-weighted average price of the security over the specified period.

## How it Works
The TWAP algorithm works by breaking up a large order into smaller orders and executing them at regular intervals over a specified period of time. For example, a TWAP order to buy 10,000 shares of a stock over a period of one hour could be executed by buying 1,000 shares every six minutes.

## Benefits of the TWAP Algorithm
- **Reduces market impact:** By breaking up a large order into smaller orders, the TWAP algorithm can reduce the market impact of the trade.
- **Simple to implement:** The TWAP algorithm is simple to implement and does not require any sophisticated modeling.
