# Smart Order Routing

Smart order routing (SOR) is an automated process used by brokers and trading firms to execute trades at the best possible price. SOR algorithms scan multiple trading venues (exchanges, dark pools, etc.) to find the optimal place to execute an order based on factors like price, liquidity, and speed.

## How it Works
A smart order router takes a large order and breaks it down into smaller pieces. It then sends these pieces to different venues where it expects to get the best execution. The SOR constantly monitors the market and will re-route orders if it finds a better opportunity elsewhere.

## Benefits of Smart Order Routing
- **Improved Execution Price:** SOR can help to achieve a better average price for a large order.
- **Reduced Market Impact:** By splitting up a large order, SOR can reduce the price impact of the trade.
- **Access to Liquidity:** SOR can tap into liquidity across multiple venues, increasing the chances of a fill.
