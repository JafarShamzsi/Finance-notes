# VWAP Algorithm

The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) algorithm is an execution algorithm that is used to execute a large order over a specified period of time. The goal of the VWAP algorithm is to execute the order at a price that is close to the volume-weighted average price of the security over the specified period.

## How it Works
The VWAP algorithm works by breaking up a large order into smaller orders and executing them in proportion to the volume of trading in the security. For example, if a security typically trades 20% of its daily volume in the first hour of trading, a VWAP order to buy 10,000 shares of the stock over the course of the day would execute 2,000 shares in the first hour.

## Benefits of the VWAP Algorithm
- **Reduces market impact:** By executing orders in proportion to the volume of trading, the VWAP algorithm can reduce the market impact of the trade.
- **More sophisticated than TWAP:** The VWAP algorithm is more sophisticated than the TWAP algorithm and can achieve better execution prices in some cases.
