# Iceberg Orders

An iceberg order is a large order that is broken up into smaller, visible orders. The goal of an iceberg order is to hide the true size of the order from the market.

## How it Works
An iceberg order has two parts: a visible part and a hidden part. The visible part is a small order that is displayed in the order book. The hidden part is a larger order that is not displayed in the order book. When the visible part of the order is executed, a new visible order is created from the hidden part of the order. This process continues until the entire order is executed.

## Benefits of Iceberg Orders
- **Reduces market impact:** By hiding the true size of the order, an iceberg order can reduce the market impact of the trade.
- **Can be used to probe for liquidity:** An iceberg order can be used to probe for liquidity in the market without revealing the true size of the order.
