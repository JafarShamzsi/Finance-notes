# Transaction Cost Analysis

Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) is the study of the costs associated with trading. These costs can be broken down into explicit costs (commissions, fees) and implicit costs (market impact, slippage). The goal of TCA is to understand and minimize these costs.

## Key Metrics
- **Implementation Shortfall:** The difference between the decision price and the final execution price, including all costs.
- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):** The average price of a security over a given period, weighted by volume.
- **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price):** The average price of a security over a given period.

## The Importance of TCA
TCA is essential for any systematic trading strategy. By understanding the costs of trading, a firm can:
- **Improve execution quality:** Find ways to reduce market impact and slippage.
- **Evaluate broker performance:** Compare the execution quality of different brokers.
- **Refine trading strategies:** Adjust strategies to be more cost-effective.
