# Trading Servers

A trading server is a computer that is used to run trading algorithms. The choice of trading server depends on a variety of factors, including the trading strategy, the budget, and the desired level of performance.

## Hardware Considerations

### CPU
- **Clock Speed:** A high clock speed is important for single-threaded applications, such as order execution.
- **Number of Cores:** A large number of cores is important for multi-threaded applications, such as backtesting and data analysis.

### Memory
- **RAM:** A large amount of RAM is important for storing market data and other trading-related data.
- **ECC (Error-Correcting Code) Memory:** ECC memory can detect and correct memory errors, which is important for mission-critical applications.

### Storage
- **SSD (Solid-State Drive):** An SSD is much faster than a traditional hard drive, which is important for applications that require fast data access, such as backtesting.
- **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** A RAID can be used to improve the performance and reliability of storage.

## Software Considerations

### Operating System
- **Linux:** Linux is the most popular operating system for trading servers, due to its performance, stability, and open-source nature.
- **Windows:** Windows is also a viable option, but it is less common for high-performance trading applications.

### Trading Software
- **Trading Platforms:** Trading platforms such as MetaTrader and NinjaTrader can be used to run trading algorithms.
- **Custom Software:** Many trading firms develop their own custom trading software in languages such as C++ and Java.
