# Cloud vs On-Premise Infrastructure

When setting up a trading infrastructure, one of the key decisions is whether to use a cloud-based or on-premise solution. Each approach has its own set of pros and cons.

## Cloud-Based Infrastructure

- **Description:** Using a cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), to host your trading infrastructure.
- **Pros:**
    - **Scalability:** Easily scale your infrastructure up or down as needed.
    - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay only for the resources you use.
    - **Ease of Use:** Cloud providers offer a wide range of services that make it easy to set up and manage your infrastructure.
- **Cons:**
    - **Latency:** Cloud-based solutions typically have higher latency than on-premise solutions.
    - **Security:** Security can be a concern when using a public cloud.

## On-Premise Infrastructure

- **Description:** Hosting your own trading infrastructure in-house.
- **Pros:**
    - **Low Latency:** On-premise solutions can provide the lowest possible latency, especially when colocated with an exchange.
    - **Security:** You have complete control over the security of your infrastructure.
- **Cons:**
    - **Cost:** On-premise solutions can be expensive to set up and maintain.
    - **Scalability:** Scaling an on-premise solution can be difficult and time-consuming.

## Hybrid Approach
A hybrid approach, which combines elements of both cloud-based and on-premise solutions, can be a good option for many trading firms. For example, you could use an on-premise server for latency-sensitive tasks, such as order execution, and a cloud-based solution for less latency-sensitive tasks, such as backtesting and data analysis.
