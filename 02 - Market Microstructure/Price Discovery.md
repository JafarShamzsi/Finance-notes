# Price Discovery

The process by which markets incorporate new information into prices. Understanding price discovery helps you know where and when prices are most "real."

## How Information Becomes Price

```
Event (earnings, news, data)
    ↓
Informed traders act first
    ↓
Order flow shifts (buy/sell imbalance)
    ↓
Price adjusts to new equilibrium
    ↓
Market makers update quotes
    ↓
New "fair value" established
```

## Venues and Price Discovery

Not all venues contribute equally:
- **Primary exchanges** — Most price discovery during regular hours
- **Futures markets** — Often lead stock prices (faster, leveraged)
- **Options markets** — Implied volatility signals
- **Dark pools** — Minimal price discovery (hidden)
- **Pre/post market** — React to earnings/news

## Practical Implications

| Observation | Trading Implication |
|---|---|
| Futures lead cash | Watch ES/NQ futures for equity signals |
| Options IV spikes before news | Monitor unusual options activity |
| Dark pool prints at premium/discount | Large informed blocks |
| Opening auction sets fair value | Gap analysis at open |
