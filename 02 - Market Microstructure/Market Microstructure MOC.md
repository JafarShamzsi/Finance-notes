# Market Microstructure — Map of Content

> **Market Microstructure** is the study of the processes and outcomes of exchanging assets under a specific set of rules. In simple terms: it is the study of how "the plumbing" of the financial system works.

For a quant, microstructure is where the battle for execution and short-term alpha is won or lost.
