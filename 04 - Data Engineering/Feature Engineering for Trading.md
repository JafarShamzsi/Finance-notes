- **Lags:** Using past values of a feature as new features.
- **Moving Averages:** Calculating the moving average of a feature over a given time period.
- **Volatility:** Calculating the volatility of a feature over a given time period.
- **Momentum:** Calculating the rate of change of a feature over a given time period.
