# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset. An unlabeled dataset is a dataset where the data points are not tagged with a known outcome. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden patterns and structures in the data.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering
- **Description:** Clustering algorithms are used to group similar data points together.
- **Examples:**
    - **K-Means Clustering:** A simple and widely used clustering algorithm.
    - **Hierarchical Clustering:** A clustering algorithm that creates a hierarchy of clusters.
    - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** A clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary shape.

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **Description:** Dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to reduce the number of features in a dataset.
- **Examples:**
    - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that is widely used in finance.
    - **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** A non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that is often used for visualizing high-dimensional data.

## Applications in Finance
- **Customer segmentation:** Clustering algorithms can be used to group customers into different segments based on their behavior.
- **Anomaly detection:** Clustering algorithms can be used to identify unusual data points that may be indicative of fraud.
- **Factor analysis:** Dimensionality reduction algorithms can be used to identify the underlying factors that are driving asset returns.
