# Mathematics — Map of Content

> "In finance, math is the language of risk and the engine of alpha."

Quantitative finance is built on several mathematical pillars. This map organizes the vault's mathematical resources from foundational probability to advanced stochastic modeling.

## 1. Probability & Statistics

The foundation of decision-making under uncertainty.
- [[Probability and Statistics for Trading]] — Distributions, testing, and measures.
- [[Cointegration]] — The math of long-term relationships.
- [[Copulas]] — Modeling dependency in the tails.
- [[Bayesian Portfolio Optimization]] — (To be created) Updating beliefs.

---

## 2. Calculus & Stochastic Processes

The math of things that move and change randomly over time.
- [[Stochastic Calculus]] — Ito's Lemma, Brownian Motion, and SDEs.
- [[Black-Scholes Model]] — The derivation of derivatives.
- [[Volatility Surface Modeling]] — Modeling the smile and skew.
- [[Interest Rate Models]] — SDEs for the yield curve.

## 3. Linear Algebra

The math of matrices, essential for multi-asset portfolios.
- [[Linear Algebra in Finance]] — Covariance, PCA, and SVD.
- [[Factor Models]] — Decomposing returns into drivers.
- [[Portfolio Optimization]] — Matrix inversion and quadratic forms.
