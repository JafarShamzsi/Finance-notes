# Risk Management — Map of Content

> "Risk management is not about avoiding risk, it is about knowing which risks you are taking and being compensated for them."

In quantitative trading, risk management is what prevents a single "Black Swan" event from bankrupting the firm. It is the most important component of any production system.

## 1. Risk Measurement (The Yardstick)

How do we quantify the danger?
- [[Value at Risk (VaR)]] — The baseline threshold loss.
- **Expected Shortfall (CVaR):** The average loss in the tail.
- [[Correlation and Diversification]] — How risks aggregate.
- [[Performance Metrics]] — Sharpe, Sortino, and Drawdown.

## 2. Risk Mitigation & Controls (The Brakes)

How do we limit the damage?
- [[Position Sizing]] — The most powerful risk tool.
- [[Kelly Criterion]] — Optimal bet sizing for growth and survival.
- [[Stop Loss Strategies]] — Hard exits for failing trades.
- [[Drawdown Management]] — Limiting peak-to-trough equity erosion.
- [[Hedging Strategies]] — Offsetting specific risk factors (Delta, Gamma, Vega).

## 3. Operational & Systemic Risk

Risks beyond the market price.
- [[Tail Risk and Black Swans]] — Preparing for the 1-in-100-year event.
- **Kill Switches:** Automated system shutdowns (see [[Monitoring and Alerting]]).
- **Fat-Finger Limits:** Preventing catastrophic input errors.
- **Model Risk:** The danger of using a flawed formula or overfitted backtest (see [[Overfitting]]).

## 4. Portfolio-Level Risk

- [[Portfolio Optimization]] — Minimizing risk for a target return.
- [[Factor Models]] — Identifying latent risk exposures (e.g., being too "Long Tech").
- [[Risk Parity]] — Balancing risk contribution instead of capital.

## 5. Regulatory Risk

- [[Regulation and Compliance MOC]] — Legal requirements.
- **Capital Adequacy:** Ensuring you have enough cash to cover margin calls.
